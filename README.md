This project is a classic Snake game built using C++ and the SFML library. The game features smooth graphics and animations powered by SFML, dynamic mechanics with increasing difficulty, and user-friendly controls for a seamless experience.

While building this project, I gained valuable experience in implementing game loops, handling real-time input, using SFML for rendering graphics and managing events, designing and managing game state logic, and debugging and optimizing C++ code for better performance. In addition, I strengthened my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming and furthered my understanding of object handling and memory.
